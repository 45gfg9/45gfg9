# 45gfg9

:wave: Hi! I'm what Garbage Collector looking for. :D

A student, teen, software and hardware tinkerer, far from pro.
Want to be a full stack dev! (Who knows)

Coping with all the reality things, can't really do some commits right now.

:moneybag: OFFERING HIGH PRICE for ways to stretch a day to 72 hours or more.

I'm deeply sorry if my code gets you vomit.
